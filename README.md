# HolyWasher

Code completely rewritten by OkraDonkey.  
No longer supports RimWorld 1.0, but it wouldn't be too hard to add.

### Not yet finished

Still in development; see Issues.

We should probably choose a license for the mod.
Code by OkraDonkey will probably get MIT license if everyone's okay with that.
